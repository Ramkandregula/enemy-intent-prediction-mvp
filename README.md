## 📌 Overview
This is a hackathon MVP that demonstrates how AI can assist defence analysts
in predicting enemy intent using movement and behavior parameters.

## 🎯 Problem
Early identification of hostile intent is difficult due to fragmented
intelligence and rapid movement changes near borders.

## 💡 Solution
An interactive dashboard that allows real-time simulation of enemy movement
and predicts threat levels (Low / Medium / High).

## ⚙️ Features
- Runtime inputs (speed, direction, formation, distance)
- AI-based threat prediction logic
- Explainable output
- Streamlit-based interactive UI

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
